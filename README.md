# Description

With this small tool you can merge several mod files into a single mod file.

# Requirements:

You need to install the [.Net Library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), the problem is that you need a Windows computer to run the Library.
But if you are a Linux user, you can use a program to run the [.Net Library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) its called [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/). Im not a linux user so I dont know how its works, but here is a [Tutorial](https://www.linux.com/news/running-net-applications-linux-mono/).

Note: Not all mods support this, such as [BL2 Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/115/). But I am already working on a solution.
