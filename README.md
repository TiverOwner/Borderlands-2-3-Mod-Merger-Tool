# Description

With this small tool you can merge several mod files into a single mod file.

# Installation:

- Windows:

You must have the [.Net Library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed. After you installed that, install the latest release of the project, export the files into a folder and run the application.

- Linux 
 
If you are a Linux user, you can use a program to run the [.Net Library](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) thats needed to run this app, this program is called [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/linux/). I am not a Linux user so I don't know how it works, but here is a [Tutorial](https://www.linux.com/news/running-net-applications-linux-mono/) that helped me.

- MacOS

If you are a MacOs user, there is a software called [WineBottler](https://winebottler.kronenberg.org/), with this application you can run Windows applications on MacOs.
Here is a tutorial that helped me to run this project on a Mac: [Click Me!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz-nI4LW2Jw)

Note: Not all mods support this, such as [BL2 Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/115/). But I am already working on a solution.
